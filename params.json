  "body": "# sm-l4d2-superboomer\r\nMake Boomer do a super charged rocket jump.  I got this inspiration from ztar's lethal weapon plugin. Credit goes to ztar for his particle code. Also added support for game instructor hints (code snippet was based from DJ_WEST's Witch Control Plugin)\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n* Super charged rocket jump\r\n* Special Attack (When attack button is pressed, boomer descends faster)\r\n* Particle Effects while charging and upon activation of the charge\r\n* Boomer can move while puking\r\n\r\n# Requirements\r\nThis plugin requires SDKHooks v1.3 or above\r\n\r\n# CVARS\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* sm_superboomer_version - Plugin Version\r\n* sm_sb_debug (0 = Disable / 1 = Enable / 2 = Enable for Admins Only) - Enable/Disable Debug Mode.\r\n* sm_sb_chargetime - Number of seconds to wait before activating (Max : 60s, Default values is 5 seconds)\r\n* sm_sb_chargeexpire - Number of seconds before charge expires (Max: 60s, Default value is 1.5secs)\r\n* sm_sb_effects (0 = Disable / 1 = Enable) - Enable/Disable Particle Effects (Depreceated)\r\n* sm_sb_explode (0 = Disable / 1 = Enable) - Make boomer explode upon impact (Default is 0)\r\n* sm_sb_gravity - The gravity to set for the jump boost (Default gravity is set to 0.06.)\r\n* sm_sb_hint - (0 = Disable, 1 = Chat, 2 = Game Instructor Hint, 3 = Both) Set which type of hints should be displayed for users\r\n* sm_sb_specialattack (0 = Disable / 1 = Enable) - Enable/Disable Speed Drop\r\n* sm_sb_pukemove **NEW** (0 = Disable, 1 = Enable) - Allow boomer to move while puking\r\n\r\n## CVARS for customizing Particle/Sound effects\r\n\r\n_Warning: Do not bother modifying these cvars unless you want to customize you're own particle/sound effects. Some particles can be quite heavy and sometimes causes clients to crash._\r\n* sm_sb_pathpe_charge - Path of particle effect for Boomer Charge\r\n* sm_sb_pathpe_jump - Path of particle effect for Boomer Jump\r\n* sm_sb_pathpe_land - Path of particle effect for Boomer Land\r\n* sm_sb_pathse_charge - Path for sound effect when charging\r\n* sm_sb_pathse_fail - Path for sound effect on charge fail\r\n* sm_sb_pathse_jump - Path for sound effect on initial jump\r\n* sm_sb_pathse_land - Path for sound effect on landing\r\n* sm_sb_pathse_ready - Path for sound effect on charge readiness indication\r\n* sm_sb_pathse_special - Path for sound effect on special attack ability\r\n* sm_sb_pathse_warcry - Path for sound effect for WAR CRY\r\n\r\n## CVARS For Enabling/Disabling Particle/Sound Effects\r\n* sm_sb_pecharge - (0 = Disable, 1 = Enabled) Enable/Disable Particle Effects when Charging\r\n* sm_sb_pejump - (0 = Disable, 1 = Enabled) Enable/Disable Particle Effects when Jumping\r\n* sm_sb_peland - (0 = Disable, 1 = Enabled) Enable/Disable Particle Effects when Landing\r\n* sm_sb_secharge - (0 = Disable, 1 = Enabled) Enable/Disable Sound Effects when Charging\r\n* sm_sb_sefail - (0 = Disable, 1 = Enabled) Enable/Disable Sound Effects after a failed charged attempt\r\n* sm_sb_sejump - (0 = Disable, 1 = Enabled) Enable/Disable Sound Effects when Jumping\r\n* sm_sb_seland - (0 = Disable, 1 = Enabled) Enable/Disable Sound Effects when Landing\r\n* sm_sb_sespecatk - (0 = Disable, 1 = Enabled) Enable/Disable Sound Effects for Special Speed Attack Ability\r\n* sm_sb_sewarcry - (0 = Disable, 1 = Enabled) Enable/Disable Sound Effects for War Cry (Occurs during the jump)\r\n\r\n# How to Use\r\n* Crouch for N seconds (this is defined by the cvar) then jump upon activation. Proper timing of the jump is crucial to make a successful super rocket jump.\r\n* To make boomer rocket jump to the desired direction, just hold down the DIRECTIONAL KEYS (W-A-S-D) prior to the jumping.\r\n* While on mid-air, press the ATTACK (By default, that is your left mouse button) key to descend faster to the ground\r\n* If any of you are curious on what to put on the particle effects cvars, I will try to compile a list of all particle effects in Left 4 Dead 2...but for the meantime, you can use the particle browser through the \"Left 4 Dead 2 (Tools Mode)\" under \"Left 4 Dead 2 Authoring Tools\". Just take note that you will need the Authoring tools installed for you to access the particle browser.\r\n\r\n# DEMO Video \r\n_made by blackalegator_\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v_nHkcZT4",
